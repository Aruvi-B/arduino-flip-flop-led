# Arduino Flip-Flop LED Project

This project demonstrates a simple LED flip-flop pattern using an Arduino Uno. The setup includes:
- Red LED on Pin 13
- Yellow LED on Pin 12
- Green LED on Pin 11

## Circuit Diagram
The circuit uses three LEDs with resistors connected to the Arduino Uno pins. You can simulate this circuit using the Wokwi simulator.
